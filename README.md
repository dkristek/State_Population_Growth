# State_Population_Growth

## Selected Topic: Forecasting Population Growth in the United States' four largest cities (Florida, Texas, California, New York)

## Reason why we selected this topic: 
There are varying opinions of whether the population of the United States is sustainable from a resources perspective. Population has a unique impact the sustainability of our climate, education system, and economy. We seek to understand the population growth trends within the United Statesâ€™ four largest cities: Texas, Florida, New York, and California. We will then use this data to make inferences about population viability.

## Description of Source Data: 
Our primary source of data is United Nations census data for the United States, China, Indonesia, and India. This includes total population statistics and growth percentages.

## Questions we hope to answer with the data:
- Is the population in the United States' largest cities growing or declining?
- Are we at a point where we should seek to accelerate or decline population expansion?
- Are certain states more likely to have stronger population growth than others?
- What will the population of these states look like in the next 5 years?
