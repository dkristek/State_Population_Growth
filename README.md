# State_Population_Growth

Selected Topic: Forecasting Population Growth in the United States' four largest cities (Florida, Texas, California, New York)

Reason why we selected this topic: There are varying opinions of whether the population of the United States is sustainable from a resources perspective. Population has a unique impact the sustainability of our climate, education system, and economy. We seek to understand the population growth trends within the United Statesâ€™ four largest cities: Texas, Florida, New York, and California. We will then use this data to make inferences about population viability.

Description of Source Data: Our primary source of data is United States census data for Texas, Florida, New York, and California. This includes total population statistics and growth percentages.

Questions we hope to answer with the data:
-Is the population in the United States' largest cities growing or declining?
-Are we at a point where we should seek to accelerate or decline population expansion?
-Are certain states more likely to have stronger population growth than others?
-What will the populatin of these states look like in the next 5 years?
